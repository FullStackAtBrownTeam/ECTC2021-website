# ECTC2021 Website

This project was built on ReactJS for Brown/RISD's Gendo Taiko group by a team of students at Full Stack at Brown.

Please see [#available-scripts] for details on building, running, and deploying the project.

## Internals

To customize the page title and metadata, edit the file `index.html`.

To customize other site content, see the file `src/content.json`. The JSON file breaks down as such:
- `splashDesktop`: Contains source file paths and styling for the splash page, including the center image and accompanying additional images (stored as a JSON array).
- `splashMobile`: Similar to `splashDesktop`, but is used on the mobile version of the webpage.
- `content`: Contains an array of objects, each representing one section of the website. Each object must contain a `"header"` field (the title of the section), a `"type"` field, and a `"content"` field. If the `type` of the section is `"html"`, then the `"content"` field is rendered as pure HTML. For convenience, the `"content"` contains an array of strings (for pretty-reading purposes), rather than a single string.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
